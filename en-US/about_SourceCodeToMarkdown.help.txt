SHORT DESCRIPTION
    Describes the SourceCodeToMarkdown PowerShell module for exporting source code to Markdown.

LONG DESCRIPTION
    The SourceCodeToMarkdown module provides tools for exporting source code files from
    directories into consolidated Markdown documents. This is useful for code reviews,
    documentation, archiving, and sharing code snippets.

    The main cmdlet is Export-SourceCodeToMarkdown, which recursively traverses directory
    structures and consolidates source code files into a single Markdown document with
    optional features including:

    - Visual tree structure of directories
    - Table of contents with clickable links
    - Syntax highlighting for various programming languages
    - Line numbering in code blocks with customizable padding
    - File metadata and statistics
    - Configurable file inclusion/exclusion patterns
    - Optional comment removal from source files
    - MarkdownLint compliance for generated output

    The module is designed with performance and flexibility in mind, supporting large
    codebases with configurable size limits and error handling.

MAIN CMDLETS
    Export-SourceCodeToMarkdown
        Exports source code files to a Markdown document.

NEW FEATURES

    Line Number Padding
        Use the -LineNumberPadding parameter to control how line numbers are formatted:

        -LineNumberPadding 'spaces' (default): Line numbers are right-aligned with spaces
        -LineNumberPadding 'zeros': Line numbers are padded with leading zeros (001, 002, etc.)

        Example:
        PS C:\> Export-SourceCodeToMarkdown -Path ".\src" -OutputPath ".\out.md" -IncludeLineNumbers -LineNumberPadding 'zeros'

    Comment Removal
        Use the -RemoveComments switch to strip comments from source files before export:

        PS C:\> Export-SourceCodeToMarkdown -Path ".\src" -OutputPath ".\clean.md" -RemoveComments -IncludeLineNumbers

        Supported comment styles:
        - PowerShell: # ... and <# ... #>
        - C-style: // ... and /* ... */
        - HTML: <!-- ... -->
        - SQL: -- ... and /* ... */
        - Python: # ...

        String literals are preserved to maintain code functionality.

    MarkdownLint Compliance
        The module now generates Markdown that complies with key markdownlint rules:

        - MD009: No trailing spaces
        - MD010: No hard tabs (4-space indentation)
        - MD012: No multiple consecutive blank lines (max 1)
        - MD013: Line length (max 120 characters)
        - MD018: Space after # in headings
        - MD022: Blank lines around headings
        - MD024: No duplicate headings (auto-suffixes added)
        - MD041: First line is H1 heading
        - MD047: Single trailing newline

EXAMPLES
    Example 1: Basic export
    PS C:\> Export-SourceCodeToMarkdown -Path ".\src" -OutputPath ".\docs\source-export.md"

    Example 2: Export with table of contents and visual tree
    PS C:\> Export-SourceCodeToMarkdown -Path ".\src" -OutputPath ".\export.md" -IncludeTableOfContents -IncludeVisualTree

    Example 3: Export specific file types with line numbers
    PS C:\> Export-SourceCodeToMarkdown -Path ".\project" -OutputPath ".\review.md" -IncludePattern "*.ps1", "*.cs" -IncludeLineNumbers

    Example 4: Export from multiple directories with exclusions
    PS C:\> Export-SourceCodeToMarkdown -Path ".\src", ".\tests" -OutputPath ".\full-export.md" -ExcludeDirectory "bin", "obj", ".git" -Force

    Example 5: Export with zero-padded line numbers
    PS C:\> Export-SourceCodeToMarkdown -Path ".\src" -OutputPath ".\numbered.md" -IncludeLineNumbers -LineNumberPadding 'zeros'

    Example 6: Export with comments removed
    PS C:\> Export-SourceCodeToMarkdown -Path ".\src" -OutputPath ".\clean.md" -RemoveComments -IncludeLineNumbers

    Example 7: Full featured export
    PS C:\> Export-SourceCodeToMarkdown -Path ".\project" -OutputPath ".\complete.md" -IncludePattern "*.ps1" -IncludeLineNumbers -LineNumberPadding 'zeros' -RemoveComments -IncludeTableOfContents -IncludeVisualTree -Force

PERFORMANCE CONSIDERATIONS
    - Processing large repositories may take significant time and memory
    - Consider using more specific IncludePatterns for large codebases
    - Output files can become very large; monitor file size
    - Binary files are automatically skipped
    - File size limits are configurable through module variables
    - Comment removal adds processing time proportional to file size

CONFIGURATION
    The module configuration is stored in $Script:ModuleConfig and includes:
    - MaxIndividualFileSize: Maximum size for individual files (default: 50MB)
    - MaxTotalOutputSize: Maximum total output size (default: 1GB)
    - DefaultEncoding: Text encoding for reading files (default: UTF8)
    - LanguageMap: Mapping of file extensions to syntax highlighting languages
    - DefaultExcludedDirectories: Directories excluded by default

SUPPORTED FILE TYPES
    The module supports syntax highlighting for many programming languages including:
    - PowerShell: .ps1, .psm1, .psd1
    - C#: .cs
    - Visual Basic: .vb
    - F#: .fs, .fsx, .fsproj
    - Python: .py, .pyw
    - JavaScript/TypeScript: .js, .ts, .jsx, .tsx
    - HTML/CSS: .html, .htm, .css, .scss, .less
    - Java: .java
    - C/C++: .c, .cpp, .h, .hpp
    - Go: .go
    - Rust: .rs
    - Ruby: .rb
    - PHP: .php
    - Swift: .swift
    - Kotlin: .kt
    - Dart: .dart
    - SQL: .sql
    - XML: .xml, .csproj, .fsproj, .vbproj
    - YAML/JSON: .yaml, .yml, .json
    - Markdown: .md
    - Shell: .sh, .bash, .zsh

KNOWN LIMITATIONS
    - Binary files are skipped automatically
    - Symlinks are not followed by default
    - Very large files (>50MB) may be skipped or cause performance issues
    - The output Markdown file may be very large for large codebases
    - Complex string literals with escaped quotes may affect comment removal
    - Triple-quoted strings (Python) are handled but may have edge cases

TROUBLESHOOTING
    Line numbers don't match original file:
        - Ensure you're not using -IncludeLineNumbers without -RemoveComments
        - If using -RemoveComments, line numbers reflect the comment-free output

    Comments not being removed:
        - Verify the file extension is supported for comment removal
        - Check that comments are not inside string literals
        - Use -Verbose to see detailed processing information

    MarkdownLint errors in output:
        - The module should automatically handle most markdownlint rules
        - If you see issues, report them on the GitHub repository
