SHORT DESCRIPTION
    Describes the SourceCodeToMarkdown PowerShell module for exporting source code to Markdown.

LONG DESCRIPTION
    The SourceCodeToMarkdown module provides tools for exporting source code files from 
    directories into consolidated Markdown documents. This is useful for code reviews, 
    documentation, archiving, and sharing code snippets.

    The main cmdlet is Export-SourceCodeToMarkdown, which recursively traverses directory 
    structures and consolidates source code files into a single Markdown document with 
    optional features including:
    
    - Visual tree structure of directories
    - Table of contents with clickable links
    - Syntax highlighting for various programming languages
    - Line numbering in code blocks
    - File metadata and statistics
    - Configurable file inclusion/exclusion patterns

    The module is designed with performance and flexibility in mind, supporting large 
    codebases with configurable size limits and error handling.

MAIN CMDLETS
    Export-SourceCodeToMarkdown
        Exports source code files to a Markdown document.

ALIASES
    Export-CodeToMarkdown
    Code2Md

EXAMPLES
    Example 1: Basic export
    PS C:\> Export-SourceCodeToMarkdown -Path ".\src" -OutputPath ".\docs\source-export.md"
    
    Example 2: Export with table of contents and visual tree
    PS C:\> Export-SourceCodeToMarkdown -Path ".\src" -OutputPath ".\export.md" -IncludeTableOfContents -IncludeVisualTree
    
    Example 3: Export specific file types with line numbers
    PS C:\> Export-SourceCodeToMarkdown -Path ".\project" -OutputPath ".\review.md" -IncludePattern "*.ps1", "*.cs" -IncludeLineNumbers
    
    Example 4: Export from multiple directories with exclusions
    PS C:\> Export-SourceCodeToMarkdown -Path ".\src", ".\tests" -OutputPath ".\full-export.md" -ExcludeDirectory "bin", "obj", ".git" -Force

PERFORMANCE CONSIDERATIONS
    - Processing large repositories may take significant time and memory
    - Consider using more specific IncludePatterns for large codebases
    - Output files can become very large; monitor file size
    - Binary files are automatically skipped
    - File size limits are configurable through module variables

CONFIGURATION
    The module configuration is stored in $Script:ModuleConfig and includes:
    - MaxIndividualFileSize: Maximum size for individual files (default: 50MB)
    - MaxTotalOutputSize: Maximum total output size (default: 1GB)
    - DefaultEncoding: Text encoding for reading files (default: UTF8)
    - LanguageMap: Mapping of file extensions to syntax highlighting languages
    - DefaultExcludedDirectories: Directories excluded by default

KNOWN LIMITATIONS
    - Binary files are skipped automatically
    - Symlinks are not followed by default
    - Very large files (>50MB) may be skipped or cause performance issues
    - The output Markdown file may be very large for large codebases
